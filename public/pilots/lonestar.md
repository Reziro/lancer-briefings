**Jesse Williams** grew up on free **Sanjak** with her friend **Adrian Gallagher**. Always the rough and tumble sort, Jesse loved hearing tales of how her people earned their freedom. When she grew up Jesse knew for certain that she wanted to go out into the black and find new adventures, maybe one or two she could be a character in. All she needed was a way off of Sanjak.

So it was that Jesse joined her friend Adrian on a **House of Water** ship bound for anywhere else. Sadly though, before the ship could reach its destination or really even start the journey, it was destroyed by the **House of Stone**. Jesse managed to eject in one of the life pods, being picked up by a passing mining vessel. The miners, a lower caste within the House of Stone, delivered Jesse to Karrakis. There, she found herself working odd jobs as hired muscle for nobles with more coin than brains. Eventually she found herself taking on a contract for the **House of Dust** in exchange for transport to the Long Rim.

Surviving in the Long Rim as an unfettered individual is difficult, so much so that Jesse turned to piracy to keep herself fed. Preferring the direct aproach, Jesse would wait for ships to dock wherever she had holed up that week and stow away until they had loaded their goods. Once they reached space she would open the cargo door and eject the goods to her associate outside. They would split the bounty and go their separate ways.

When **Union** approached Jesse with an offer of steady employment, free food and adventure among the stars she couldn't turn them down. Partly because they had her surrounded in one of their supply running ships. She didn't expect to be re-united with Adrian, convinced that he had died months ago in the explosion that took out their ship, but it was a welcome surprise. She was quickly assigned to **Revolutionary Squad** on recommendation from Aces.

As a member of **Revolutionary Squad** Jesse, callsign **Lonestar**, takes on the role of **Forward Gunner and Heavy Weapons Specialist**. Relying on the same **IPS-N** licenses that she had used during her time as a pirate Lonestar still prefers a **direct and violent** approach. Whether holding the line or advancing on enemies, Lonestar is most comfortable **in the highest threat zone**.
