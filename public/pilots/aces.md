**Adrian Gallagher** was born on the planet **Sanjak** long after the revolution had finished. His parents were involved in the ongoing project to fully free Sanjak from the threat of the **House of Stone**. While growing up Adrian was taught various disciplines and became well versed in computer science and engineering.

Alongside his childhood friend **Jesse Williams** Adrian hitched a ride on a **House of Water** vessel that had managed to slip through the blockade. Shortly after exiting the atmosphere of the planet the ship was destroyed and lifepods were jettisoned. Adrian drifted through space in his pod until long after the oxygen had depleted. When he was revived on a Union ship parts of his body had been replaced with mechanical components as flesh printing was deemed to be too time consuming for the emergency operation. **The new lungs felt right** and with that Adrian realized what he was missing.

As part of **Revolutionary Squad** Aces takes the role of **NHP Specialist and Recon**. As most of his enhancements are a mix of homebrew or SSC tech it only makes sense that he prefers to pilot **Smith Shimano Corpro Frames**. Aces does his best in **target rich environments** where his long range hacking can cause untold chaos.
