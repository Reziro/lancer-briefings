**Billy Bob Smithson** was a vat-born, Mechanic bio-patterned, Harrison Armories official template assigned to work on Prospect Station for Prospect Industrial Holdings, a subsidiary of Harrison Armories. Being literally purpose born for mechanic work, Longshot is **handy with a wrench** and can make heads or tails of most any mechanical object you put in front of him. Due to the constant budget cutting and lack of functional tools on station, Longshot developed quite the knack for **jury rigging** and can hold together a mechanized walker with some 2x4 lumber and a staple gun if he had to.

After meeting and working with **Voldrin Montrose** for a few months while he was on the run from the baronies Billy Bob was convinced to join up with **Union**. Being told the pay was better and the education would be more rigorous was all Longshot had to hear.

As part of **Revolutionary Squad** Billy Bob serves the role of **Lead Mechanic and Demolitionist**. His frames of choice have been Harrison Armories patterns that he is highly equipped to maintain and utilize. Providing mostly **Long Range Explosive** support, Longshot is most comfortable in the back lines where he has time to build his heat while offloading massive amounts of damage.
