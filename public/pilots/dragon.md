**Voldrin Montrose** was born to a former noble family within the republic of the **House of Water**. In his early adult years Voldrin traveled to the martial academy on Karrakis Prime and learned the ways of knighthood. Being a member of the House of Water Voldrin believes in equality and supporting his fellow humans. Often times he found himself butting heads with other nobles, who believed themselves superior by birth.

While Voldrin was on a pleasure trip to celebrate his graduation his family attempted to escort a group of the Free People of Sanjak off of their planet to bring them to other resistance cells throughout Barony space. However, his family's ship was **destroyed** by the **House of Stone**. After the debris was identified to have belonged to house Montrose the House of Stone called for their immediate execution. Voldrin, seeing the change on the wind, caught a ship heading out of port towards **Harrison controlled space** and began to lay low while plotting his next moves.

His family was mostly safe, the House of Water refusing to surrender them to the other houses, but seperated as he was and with no way of returning Voldrin knew he would need to **survive alone**. The criminalization of his once high house only did more to radicalize Voldrin. On board **Prospect Orbital** Voldrin worked alongside Harrison Armories standard pattern employees, as expendable as they were numerous. Arguably worse than the baronies, Harrison reduced human life to a number.

After signing on board with a **Union** cruiser Voldrin took the callsign **Dragon** and began to pursue a career as a naval officer. Working up to **Chief Petty Officer** Voldrin was placed in a squad of like-minded individuals.

As a member of **Revolutionary Squad** Dragon serves the role of **Negotiator and Squad Coordinator** though he is prone to calling himself the "Commander". His frames of choice tend to be **HORUS** pattern groups outfitted for **melee combat**. Using his **Pankrati** training, Dragon is able to close distance quickly and deal large amounts of damage in a very short period of time.
