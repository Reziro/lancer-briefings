After further exploration, the squad encounters a **TRIAGE CENTER** filled with the dead and dying in uniforms clearly marking them as **HERCYNIAN RANGERS**.

**DTHALL ORDO** makes her appearance, introducing herself once more to the squad. She explains that their people have been sending **SCOUTS** to the area of **EVERGREEN** but none have returned alive.
