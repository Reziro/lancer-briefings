# Union Dropship // 2.21.5014u
Assembled together under Union as agents intended to sow discord in worlds controlled by the trade baronies, the squad known by the codename **REVOLUTIONARIES** was on a transport run to their first official target in Barony space when they received a sudden distress call. The as of that time mostly uninhabited planetoid known as **HERCYNIA** was transmitting a wide band call for help. Guided by Union Administrator **MIRACLE WORKER**, the squad was immediately awoken from cryo sleep to begin an emergency sortie to the planet below. 

# Union Dropship // 3.01.5014u

After a week's worth of preparation and maintenance **REVOLUTIONARIES** are given their final briefing by UA **MIRACLE WORKER**. Not much is disclosed during the briefing past what the character's already knew. The initial contact packet outlines the group's mission thusly:

1. Union’s imperative dictates that the squad treat the situation with utmost care. Hercynia is potentially populated by some sort of indigenous human culture, but the evidence is unclear.
2. The current holder of Hercynia’s charter is Landmark Colonial, a subsidiary of SmithShimano Corpro. The Squad is to make contact with Landmark’s representative on the ground first in order to present their credentials and integrate into the local hierarchy.
3. Hercynia was once subject to a widespread and catastrophic SecComm expeditionary campaign. The records lack detail, but building from what has been recovered from the old Union Colonial Mission indicates that the Second Committee mounted a handful of similar campaigns against resistant populations. This likely accounts for the massive amount of radiation, distress signals, encrypted comms, and general “noise” coming off the world. The squad should expect to encounter old Union military infrastructure in the form of unexploded ordinance, waste radiation, and possibly even abandoned ground-based installations.

The squad board the landing vessel assigned to them, their mechs loaded into drop pods for rapid insertion after they have confirmed safe landing and exit.

# Union Shuttle Carrier // 3.01.5014u

The squad begins their descent towards the planet **HERCYNIA**.

As they approach the world, their ship’s SIGINT deck reports that Hercynia is throwing off an incredible amount of noise – likely because it is a post-collapse SecComm “punching bag” world littered with old, decaying military infrastructure, and ruins – and they find themselves unable to get clear signals. All of this matches the thin profile pushed to them by local flightcomm. Unfortunately, optics are shot as well. Hercynia appears to be socked in under a planetwide monsoon season, blanketing all but the most extreme poles with thick cloud cover.

The squad lands safely, dismounts from the shuttle, and begins assembling their gear as a small group approaches the shuttle. The group introduces themselves as a militia, with **BRAVA HADURA** as their Commander. She quickly informs them to get moving – and stay low, as there's a sniper in the area. The shuttle then begins its automated launch sequence, only to return a year from now.
